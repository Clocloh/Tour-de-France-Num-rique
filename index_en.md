Presentation: 

Digital Brain A.C is a young start-up specialized in web and digital fields, which is composed of Aicha EZZIKI (project leader, web developer, web designer) and Chloé HENRIQUES (web designer, web developer).

We noticed that companies had difficulty to find trainees or work-study students on a synchronized platform. Students also face problems to get an internship or a training.

Our web application "Les compagnons du numérique" (The Digital Companions) aims to bring together different actors with the digital professions in common. It is a mutual aid network which allows to create strong links. 
Digital Brain A.C proposes an application with a personalized training itinerary for students. 
With this itinerary simulator, the student will be able to identify the training courses or host companies according to his/her academic level.

As well recruiters will be able to advertise job offers more easily in order to find (by the most conveniently way) a trainee and to discover the rare pearl!
